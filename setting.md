Norrie is a rustic collection of cabins nestled in the White River National Forest. Katie grew spending a lot of time here at her family cabins, and has enjoyed introducing Doug to this special place. Part of what makes Norrie special is that it is off-the-map! The cabins are remote and there is no cellphone service (the closest cell range is about 30 minutes down valley). We are also at elevation, 8,461 feet above sea level.

Getting there
Norrie is 28 miles up the Frying Pan River Road from Basalt Colorado which is the nearest town and a good place to find housing for the wedding weekend (more on accommodation options below).

Transportation will be provided from Basalt to the wedding venue (more on transportation below).

There are a number of airport options for getting to/from the Basalt/Norrie area:

Aspen (ASE): Aspen is the closest airport -- it's about 20 minutes to Basalt. Flights into Aspen tend to be more expensive than Denver with more limited availability.
Eagle (EAG): Eagle is the second closest airport, and is right outside of Vail (~1.5 hr from Vail to Basalt). Similar to Aspen, flights into Eagler tend to be slightly more expensive than flying into Denver, but is worth checking.
Denver (DEN): Denver airport is also a good option (approximately 4 hours from Basalt). If you decide to fly into Denver but would rather not rent a car, there are several transportation companies that provide service to Basalt from DEN.
Please note that this weekend is also Food and Wine Week in Aspen which will draw a lot of people to the valley so we recommend booking flights and lodging early!

Where to stay
Convenient hotels from which transportation will be provided include:

Element Basalt-Aspen Hotel. A block of rooms are being reserved under “The White/Proctor wedding” We recommend asking for rooms facing The Crown mountain range (away from the highway). Located at 499 Market Street, Basalt, CO 81621. Contact: (970-340-4040).

There may also be good Airbnb options in Basalt that are walking distance to The Basalt Mountain Inn where the bus will pick up guests
Aspen and Snowmass are both fun places to stay and approximately 25 and 35 minutes from Basalt respectively. However, please note that our wedding bus will not be picking up from those locations. However, there are easy and frequent public bus transportation between Aspen, Snowmass, and Basalt.
