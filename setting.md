<h1> Norrie </h1>
Norrie is a rustic collection of cabins nestled in the White River National
Forest. Katie grew spending a lot of time here at her family cabins, and has
enjoyed introducing Doug to this special place. Part of what makes Norrie
special is that it is off-the-map! The cabins are remote and there is no
cellphone service (the closest cell range is about 30 minutes down valley). We
are also at elevation, 8,461 feet above sea level.

Norrie is 28 miles up the Frying Pan River Road from Basalt Colorado which is
the nearest town and a good place to find housing for the wedding weekend (more
on accommodation options below). Driving directions are

Note that Google Maps often erroneously thinks Frying Pan River Road is closed.
Don't be fooled! It is the best way to drive to Norrie.

Transportation will be provided from Basalt to the wedding venue (more on transportation below).

There are a number of airport options for getting to/from the Basalt/Norrie area:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VhQUu14m1NJWKMLQ9">Aspen (ASE)</a>: Aspen is
the closest airport -- it's about 20 minutes to Basalt. Flights into Aspen tend
to be more expensive than Denver with more limited availability.</li>

<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VhQUu14m1NJWKMLQ9">Eagle (EGE)</a>: Eagle is
the second closest airport, and is right outside of Vail (~1.5 hr from Vail to
Basalt). Similar to Aspen, flights into Eagler tend to be slightly more
expensive than flying into Denver, but is worth checking.</li>

<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VhQUu14m1NJWKMLQ9">Denver (DEN)</a>: Denver
airport is also a good option (approximately 4 hours from Basalt). If you decide
to fly into Denver but would rather not rent a car, there are several
transportation companies that provide service to Basalt from DEN.</li>
</ul>
Please note that this weekend is also [Food and Wine
Week](https://www.foodandwine.com/promo/events/aspen-classic/classic-main) in
Aspen which will draw a lot of people to the valley so we recommend booking
flights and lodging early!
