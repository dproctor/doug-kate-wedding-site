<h1 id="getting-to-wedding" name="getting-to-wedding"> Getting to the wedding </h1>

Transportation will be provided to the venue from [The Element
Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/aseel-element-basalt-aspen/)
in Willits and from [The Basalt Mountain
Inn](https://www.basaltmountaininn.com/) in Basalt. Please indicate in your RSVP
whether or not you plan to use this transportation option.

If you are staying at an Airbnb or another hotel that is not of the stops for
the bus going to the wedding venue, you are still welcome to take the bus. Make
your way to either either [The Element
Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/aseel-element-basalt-aspen/)
in Willits or [The Basalt Mountain Inn](https://www.basaltmountaininn.com/) in
Basalt to catch the bus from town up to Norrie.

<h2 id="carpool" name="carpool"> Carpooling </h2>

If you're renting a car and have extra space and would be open to having other
wedding guests contact you to hitch a ride to/from the airport, or if you're
looking to hitch a ride, we have a shared Google spreadsheet <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TypO89uOltNfsrTQDvkW1ROw6cpPm4N8XSqHf8gD0Do/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

To the extent you're looking to carpool, please connect directly with other
guests -- Doug and Katie won't be able to help coordinate carpooling.

<h1> Getting around the valley </h1>

If you are not renting a car and want to get around the valley, the local
public transportation <a href="https://www.rfta.com/">RFTA</a> is very easy to
navigate and runs frequently.
