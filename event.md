**Time**: Join us starting at 6pm

**Location**: Denver Botanic Gardens at 1007 York Street Denver, CO 80206

**Attire**: Cocktail attire, with something warm to ensure you are able to enjoy the gardens!

**Accommodations**: There are plenty of great options in Denver whether you opt for Airbnb or a hotel! Some of our favorite neighborhoods include the Cheesman Park neighborhood and the Congress Park neighborhood (both very close to our venue!), as well as the Highland neighborhood which is a very short drive away.

**Getting around**: Ubers and Lyfts are easy in Denver. If you're renting a car, the Denver Botanic Gardens has ample parking at their parking lot on the east side of the gardens.

**RSVP**: Please RSVP through your PaperlessPost invite as soon as possible but no later than November 1st 2021.

**COVID Safety**: In order to keep all of our guests safe, we will require that every guest be vaccinated or that they provide proof of a negative COVID test taken within 24 hours prior to the event. Please get in touch if you have any extenuating circumstances.

**What to do in Denver**: If you have extra time on Saturday or Sunday to explore the city check out the Clyfford Still Museum (Katie and Doug's favorite art museum in Denver), take a walk around Cheesman or Washington Park (weather permitting), and snag a breakfast burrito at Onefold (also great for lunch!).
