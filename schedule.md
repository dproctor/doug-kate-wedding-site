<h1> Weather</h1>
June in the Rockies can be unpredictable. It can snow, rain, or shine. Please
check your weather app as we get closer to the date to be prepared.

<h1> Attire</h1>
For dress, we suggest “comfy cocktail” and “mountain formal.” What does this
mean? Please feel free to dress up for the special occasion but be practical and
comfortable! We recommend shoes that can easily traverse dirt roads and grassy
fields. We also recommend layers since once the sun sets in the mountains, it
does get cold.
